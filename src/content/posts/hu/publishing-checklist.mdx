Before publishing a new post, run through this quick checklist:

1. Read through the text.
2. Double-check that code snippets compile or run.
3. Generate a cover image if the article needs one.
4. Share the link on your channels.

> Pro tip: Schedule social media posts in advance so you can focus on community feedback after publishing.

### Useful Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Everything is ready once both commands run without errors.
