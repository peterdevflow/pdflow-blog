# React Dashboard Project

This is a comprehensive admin dashboard I built using modern web technologies. The project showcases my skills in React development, data visualization, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Real-time Data**: Live charts and metrics using Chart.js
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Automatic theme switching
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with Tailwind CSS

## Technologies Used

- React 18 with hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for data visualization
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls

## Key Components

The dashboard includes several key components:

1. **Analytics Overview** - Summary cards with key metrics
2. **Interactive Charts** - Line, bar, and pie charts
3. **Data Tables** - Sortable and filterable tables
4. **User Management** - CRUD operations for users
5. **Settings Panel** - Configuration options

## Challenges & Solutions

During development, I faced several challenges:

- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with React.memo and useMemo
- **State Management**: Implemented efficient state management patterns
- **API Integration**: Built robust error handling and loading states

## Results

The dashboard successfully handles thousands of data points with smooth performance and provides an excellent user experience across all devices.
