Welcome to the new blog! This project now reads content from simple Markdown files and transforms them into React components using **MDX**.

```tsx
export function Hello({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <p>Hello, {name}! 👋</p>;
}
```

You can embed React components directly alongside your Markdown. This means dynamic UI elements, highlights, or interactive examples live right where you write.

## What's Next?

- Write posts in the `src/content/posts` folder.
- Add front matter for metadata.
- Use any React component inline when your Markdown needs a little help.

Happy writing!
